## What is a webring?

A webring is a collection of websites traditionally linked together by a circular structure. A website which is part of a webring will have an icon on its site linking either to the central webring or another site which is part of the ring.

## Who can join the webring?

The webring is open to current participants and alumns of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> The webring welcomes sites such as personal websites, blogs, wikis, or portfolios. The aforementioned are just examples: if your online home is something else please do still add yourself to the ring.

We discourage the additon of business sites or social media profiles.

## Contributions

This is an ongoing community project: if you want to contribute feel free to submit pull requests or contact Jonathan on Zulip.

## Ideas for new features

- Provide several ways of traversing the webring. Currently you can only traverse the ring in a circle-like pattern. Once at the central site you can click on one of the links or you can click the "random" button to visit a random page.
- Find themes shared by ring sites by doing textual analysis / topic modelling. Then allow sorting of sites based on these on the central site.
